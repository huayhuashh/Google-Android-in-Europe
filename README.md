# Google-Android-in-Europe
Economic study prepared for Google to assess the benefits that Android offers to consumers, app developers, device manufacturers and the wider digital industry across Europe. 

Full report available at [Oxera](https://www.oxera.com/Android).

## Context
During my time working as an economic consultant at Oxera, I have worked on a couple of projects for Google. In one of those projects, we assessed the benefits of Google Android in Europe. Working for Google always pushed us to expand our comfort zone, and find innovative ways to add value to standard economic analysis. 

For this study, in particular, we relied on unsupervised learning techniques in R to cluster user groups and perform a profiling analyis using survey data on 6,000 Android users from Kantar Media. This allowed us to identify and investigate four distinct Android user clusters:
- Heavy users of advanced functionality
- Heavy users of basic functionality
- Light users of basic functionality
- Light users

The Oxera report in pdf format is available in the repo. More detail on the clustering analyis can be found in Appendix A4.

## Next steps
Due to confidentiality issues, it is not allowed to publish the underlying code or the survey data used for the analysis on GitHub. However, for those interested, the output may nevertheless serve as an inspiration for future research.
